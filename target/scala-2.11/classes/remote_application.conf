    # There are two main reasons to delay the start of the request timeout timer:
    # 1. On the host-level API with pipelining disabled:
    #    If the request cannot be sent immediately because all connections are
    #    currently busy with earlier requests it has to be queued until a
    #    connection becomes available.
    # 2. With pipelining enabled:
    #    The request timeout timer starts only once the response for the
    #    preceding request on the connection has arrived.
    # Set to `infinite` to completely disable request timeouts.
